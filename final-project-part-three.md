# Changes made since Part II
Since completing Part II, I focused on transforming the rough wireframes and early sketches into a coherent, polished Shorthand presentation. The main changes involved tightening the story structure, simplifying visualizations, and removing extra concepts that distracted from the central takeaway. I re-evaluated the order of sections so that readers encounter the “why this matters” explanation first, followed by the data-driven insights.

I also incorporated feedback from interviews and peer critique sessions, which highlighted that some earlier drafts were too analysis-heavy. As a result, I rewrote several sections to be more narrative, added clearer transitions, and reworked the introduction to frame the problem in terms of everyday experiences that people in Pittsburgh can relate to. This helped keep the story accessible to a non-technical audience.

Another major update was strengthening the conclusions from each chart. In Part II, many visuals were functional but lacked explicit meaning. For Part III, I added short interpretations beneath each visualization so readers understand what the patterns actually imply for enforcement practices.

## The audience
My final audience is Pittsburgh residents, commuters, and graduate students—particularly those who interact with parking enforcement or are curious about how fines and violations are distributed across the city. From user interviews, I learned that most people don’t want technical explanations; they want a clear story, simple visuals, and interpretations that connect to real experiences.

Personas created in Part II helped refine this. The target persona is a busy, practical reader who wants to understand whether enforcement is fair and consistent, without diving into complex data methods. This pushed me to reduce detail, keep charts intuitive, and explain insights in plain language.

I made several adjustments based on audience needs:
- Reduced chart density and avoided overly granular breakdowns
- Rewrote captions to clearly state the takeaway, not just describe the chart
- Added more real-world framing (“What this means for drivers…”)
- Prioritized neighborhood-level and time-of-day patterns, which interviewees found most relatable

Overall, the audience focus shaped almost every design and writing decision in Part III.

## Final design decisions
Several design decisions guided the completion of Part III:
- Minimal color palette: I used a small set of colors throughout the story to reduce distraction and keep attention on the trends.
- Consistent chart types: I intentionally used similar styles (bar/line) to avoid forcing readers to constantly re-learn how to read each section.
- Short, direct captions: Each visualization includes one clear message to help readers interpret the data immediately.
- Scroll-based storytelling: The Shorthand layout supports pacing, allowing information to be revealed in small pieces rather than overwhelming the audience.
- Reorganized section flow: I moved the problem framing earlier and placed neighborhood comparisons before time-based charts, since audience testing showed this order was more intuitive.

What stood out during this process was how different a polished data story is from a technical report. Many design choices were not about data accuracy but about how a human reader absorbs information. The biggest insight I learned is how important pacing, clarity, and simplicity are when communicating with a general audience.

# Final thoughts
Completing Part III brought all the earlier components together into a finished story. The biggest challenge was refining the narrative so it stayed accessible while still grounded in real data patterns. I am most satisfied with how the final sequence of visualizations builds a logical flow from problem statement to insights. If I had more time, I would have explored more granular violation categories and potentially added an interactive component, but I’m happy with how the overall experience turned out.
