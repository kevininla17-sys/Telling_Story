# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project. 

1. Opening Context — Pittsburgh’s Long-Term Entrepreneurship Decline
A single-metro line chart shows 45 years of declining business entry rates in Pittsburgh (Visual 1). This establishes the core problem: the region’s entrepreneurial dynamism has eroded well before any broadband reforms.

2. Peer Comparison — Pittsburgh vs Rust Belt Controls
A multi-line comparison (Visual 2) highlights how Pittsburgh’s decline tracks, but slightly underperforms, similar Rust Belt metros (Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus). This positions Pittsburgh relative to comparable regions and reinforces the need for structural interventions.

3. Treatment Evidence — Before/After Open-Access Fiber Rollouts
A two-panel small multiple (Visual 3) contrasts Provo (2013 rollout) and Huntsville (2018 rollout). Both metros show improved or stabilized entry rates following fiber deployment, illustrating the potential economic effects of open-access broadband systems.

4. Implication for Pittsburgh
Based on the observed effects in treated cities, later sections of the Shorthand story will model hypothetical impacts for Pittsburgh under different broadband models. This will be developed further in Part III.

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story.

The story primarily targets:
- Local policymakers and economic development officials in Pittsburgh
- Civic-technology advocates and broadband policy stakeholders
- Business community members interested in regional competitiveness
- Students and professionals seeking to understand the impact of broadband infrastructure on entrepreneurship

| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Assess clarity of narrative                | “What do you think the main story is so far?”                      |
| Evaluate comprehension of visuals          | “Is each chart easy to understand? Which, if any, were confusing?” |

| Test interpretability of treatment effects | “What do you take away from the Provo and Huntsville charts?”      |
| Review pacing and flow                     | “Does the sequence of visuals feel logical?”                       |
| Determine emotional/strategic resonance    | “Which visual feels the most persuasive, and why?”                 |

## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

A total of three interviews were conducted. Participants included:
- A graduate student from a public policy program
- A data visualization student familiar with Tableau
- A student who is experienced with city planning and development

| **Questions**                    | **Interview 1**                                                                                                                | **Interview 2**                                                                        | **Interview 3**                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What is the main story so far?   | Clear connection between broadband and economic activity, but wanted more context on Pittsburgh’s current broadband landscape. | Understood comparison across cities but asked for more explanation of baseline levels. | Strong takeaway that open-access models seemed most effective.    |
| Was any chart confusing?         | The Huntsville trend line needed more clarity on rollout year.                                                                 | Rust Belt comparison was clear; suggested labeling each city directly near lines.      | Provo chart was easy; Huntsville needed slightly more annotation. |
| What is missing?                 | More explanation of why entry rates matter economically.                                                                       | Suggested adding a short summary before each visual.                                   | Wanted a simple definition of “entry rate” and “dynamism.”        |
| Which visual is most persuasive? | Provo & Huntsville treatment chart.                                                                                            | Rust Belt comparison.                                                                  | Long-run Pittsburgh decline.                                      |
| Suggested improvements           | More consistent color usage.                                                                                                   | Add light context text in Shorthand.                                                   | Consider including job creation as a supporting metric.           |

| **Research Synthesis**                                              | **Anticipated Changes for Part III**                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Readers want clearer definitions of economic terms.                 | Add brief text boxes defining “entry rate,” “dynamism,” and “treatment effect.”               |
| Some charts need clearer labeling and more consistent color themes. | Standardize color palettes and add direct data labels for key cities.                         |
| Pittsburgh requires more baseline context.                          | Add a short section describing Pittsburgh's broadband environment today.                      |
| Treatment charts need clearer rollout indicators.                   | Add stronger annotations and harmonize reference line formatting.                             |
| Some readers want more metrics than just entry rate.                | Add supporting visuals (e.g., net job creation, reallocation rate) if time allows.            |
| Flow between visuals needs smoother transitions.                    | Build clear narrative sections: problem → comparison → treatment → application to Pittsburgh. |


> ...include any final thoughts you have here. 

The research confirms that the visuals are compelling but would benefit from more explanatory text and consistent formatting. Part III will prioritize clarity, narrative flow, and stronger contextual framing around Pittsburgh’s specific challenges and opportunities.

# Moodboards / personas
> If you did this optional part, include details here.  Otherwise remove this section

Clean, minimalistic, data-journalism inspired aesthetic. Influences include the Financial Times and New York Times visual storytelling style: muted color palettes, thin lines, generous whitespace, and concise annotations.
